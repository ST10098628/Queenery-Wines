Problem addressed:
•	The company doesn’t have an existing website, we have never tried creating one because the company is still short of the website manager and any other problems the company faces is the stock storage. We don’t have enough space for the stock due to the shortage of the storage. 

•	Delivery is also an issue because we have to travel miles for about +\- 50 kilometers to meet the delivery officer in the near town (Vryheid). So, it actually does cost the company whenever we have single delivery.
